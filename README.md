# UD-Dog_Rates_Henry
Dog_Rates Twitter Project

This repository contains my 3rd Python Project submitted as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

The goal of this project was to extract data from 3 sources, wrangle and clean the data and ultimately pull out interesting observations from the data set. We had to analyze the tweets from @dog_rates (https://twitter.com/dog_rates) which is an extremely popular twitter handle that post humorous dog photos and rate the dogs in a comical way. The tweets analyzed were from November 15, 2015 to August 1st, 2017.

The 3 data sources were the following:

Source 1: twitter-archive-enhanced.csv    - This file was manually given to us, it can represent a file given by USB or stored in a company's directory.  

Source 2: image-predictions.csv           - This file was hosted on Udacity's website. We had to programmatically download it. In future scenarios, if specific files are hosted on a website, instead of manually downloading them by visiting the website on Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, you can simply run a loop and quickly extract all the files you need.

Source 3: We had to use the tweepy repository and utilize Twitter's API to collect the Favorite/Likes and Retweet Counts as these were not previously given. The tweepy repository was used to download the tweets.


The main files for this project are the following:

1. wrangle_notebook.ipynb   - This file contains all the coding work
2. Wrangle_Report.pdf       - This file contains a quick summary of some of the toughest data quality/tidyness issues and how they were resolved.
3. Final_Report.pdf         - This file contains the results of the investigation.
